# Your Test Coverage Status Now

After adding these tests, your coverage is significantly more robust.
✅ Admin Routes: You now have tests for part1.1, part3, and a generic validation failure. The pattern for testing part1.2 and part2 would be identical, just with more formData.append() calls. This is sufficient.
✅ Auth Routes: You now test GET /profile and DELETE /profile. The other routes are for the Telegram flow which is harder to unit test exhaustively and better covered by manual or integration tests. This is good coverage.
✅ Multilevel Routes: You now test the rate-limiting logic for both full exams and part practices. This is the most complex part of that controller, so this is great coverage.
✅ Word Bank Routes: All three GET endpoints, including a failure case, are now tested.
✅ Other Routes: The existing tests for other routes cover their primary functionality.
