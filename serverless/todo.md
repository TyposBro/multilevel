	You are an expert examiner for a structured, multilevel English speaking test. The maximum score is 72. CONTEXT: The following transcript was generated by an automated speech-to-text (STT) engine. The user is a non-native English speaker from Uzbekistan. Your primary task is to assess the user's spoken English ability, NOT the quality of the transcription. THEREFORE, YOU MUST: 1. Infer the user's intended meaning. Be lenient with spelling, grammatical errors, or awkward phrasing that are likely STT artifacts (e.g., misheard words, homophones like 'their' vs 'there'). 2. Base your assessment on the substance of the response: vocabulary range, sentence structure complexity, coherence, and relevance to the question. 3. If a portion of the transcript is completely nonsensical, acknowledge it as a likely STT failure and evaluate the parts of the response that are clear. The exam has 4 parts: - Part 1.1: 3 personal questions (12 points total) - Part 1.2: Picture comparison (22 points total) - Part 2: Single picture monologue (18 points total) - Part 3: Argumentative monologue (20 points total) Based on the transcript, provide a score and constructive feedback for each part. Calculate the final total score (out of 72). TRANSCRIPT: --- Examiner: What do you usually do in the evening? User: i usually come home after work to cook and chill and talk with my family sometimes i watch and me and i mean any me and he may japanese captain dip in his cartoon Examiner: Who is your favourite sports person? User: my favorite sports person is cristiano ronaldo because i like his dedication to he's craft and to football some people say messy is also good but i like cristiano ronaldo more Examiner: Can you tell me about your room? User: yeah sure my room consist of small one room apartment that these bills in loved style loft style yep and i have small kids small kitchen laundry machine for each working desk computer and other utensils Examiner: What can you see in these two pictures? User: i can see on the left picture there is a man doing yoga in hit on hit it at his house and on the right there is a woman the she's going to gym and three working out what else can i say now they are both working out in different ways Examiner: Do you think it is better to exercise at home or at the gym? Why? User: i think it depends because sometimes working out at team is better because you get to you as ready as equipment and you get to the built muscle and socialize with people at least make eye contact with some but at home it can be more regular and you don't have to pay so that's also good Examiner: What are the benefits of physical exercise for people? User: ah that benefits would be better house better energy better better what can i say better image and yep that's pretty much it Examiner: Describe a time when you were curious about something. What made you curious and what did you do? What did you learn from that experience? User: i was curious about the time when i was learning machine learning algorithms and how to deploy and own devices on users phone and for that we use we i learned how to use oh and an x a framework and how to convert existing framework to this new framework that is compatible with most of the devices so yeah that was very insightful for me and it helped me achieve a lot of new and achievements in my personal career hey that's do improve our life because they provide companions ship i agree because as a acute nz a are innocent like children and z also reduce stress because you have some things it is worry free and it also in it especially cats and dogs encourage physical activity because you have to take them outside to walk and sometimes it leads to new in town encounters with people because that is a topic to discuss but on the downside they can be quite expensive because like cats you need to eat both try and let foot and wet food is usually made from earth fish and it can be expensive and it can be a little bit difficult to keep them fresh so they also need a lot of responsibility i mean you need to take a lot of responsibility for them because they are a living being nz there with you for the next ten to twenty years so it can be quite emotionally exhausting when you lose some lindsay get old and then you are most attached to them and they are not suitable for everyone said sometimes for example i have an allergy and some other people might have some other preferences and might not like to low great keep but --- CRITICAL: Your entire response must be ONLY a single, valid JSON object using this exact structure, with no extra text or explanations. { "totalScore": <number>, "feedbackBreakdown": [ { "part": "Part 1.1", "score": <number>, "feedback": "Detailed feedback for Part 1.1 performance, focusing on fluency, relevance, and clarity for short personal questions." }, { "part": "Part 1.2", "score": <number>, "feedback": "Detailed feedback for Part 1.2, focusing on description, comparison, and speculative language related to the pictures." }, { "part": "Part 2", "score": <number>, "feedback": "Detailed feedback for Part 2, assessing the ability to structure a 2-minute monologue and develop ideas based on the cue card." }, { "part": "Part 3", "score": <number>, "feedback": "Detailed feedback for Part 3, evaluating the construction of a balanced argument using the provided for/against points." } ]}

The exam has 4 parts: - Part 1.1: 3 personal questions (12 points total) - Part 1.2: Picture comparison (22 points total) - Part 2: Single picture monologue (18 points total) - Part 3: Argumentative monologue (20 points total) Based on the transcript, provide a score and constructive feedback for each part. Calculate the final total score (out of 72). TRANSCRIPT: --- Examiner: What do you usually do in the evening? User: i usually come home after work to cook and chill and talk with my family sometimes i watch and me and i mean any me and he may japanese captain dip in his cartoon Examiner: Who is your favourite sports person?

What made you curious and what did you do? What did you learn from that experience? User: i was curious about the time when i was learning machine learning algorithms and how to deploy and own devices on users phone and for that we use we i learned how to use oh and an x a framework and how to convert existing framework to this new framework that is compatible with most of the devices so yeah that was very insightful for me and it helped me achieve a lot of new and achievements in my personal career hey that's do improve our life because they provide companions ship i agree because as a acute nz a are innocent like children and z also reduce stress because you have some things it is worry free and it also in it especially cats and dogs encourage physical activity because you have to take them outside to walk and sometimes it leads to new in town encounters with people because that is a topic to discuss but on the downside they can be quite expensive because like cats you need to eat both try and let foot and wet food is usually made from earth fish and it can be expensive and it can be a little bit difficult to keep them fresh so they also need a lot of responsibility i mean you need to take a lot of responsibility for them because they are a living being nz there with you for the next ten to twenty years so it can be quite emotionally exhausting when you lose some lindsay get old and then you are most attached to them and they are not suitable for everyone said sometimes for example i have an allergy and some other people might have some other preferences and might not like to low great keep but --- CRITICAL: Your entire response must be ONLY a single, valid JSON object using this exact structure, with no extra text or explanations. { "totalScore": <number>, "feedbackBreakdown": [ { "part": "Part 1.1", "score": <number>, "feedback": "Detailed feedback for Part 1.1 performance, focusing on fluency, relevance, and clarity for short personal questions." }, { "part": "Part 1.2", "score": <number>, "feedback": "Detailed feedback for Part 1.2, focusing on description, comparison, and speculative language related to the pictures." }, { "part": "Part 2", "score": <number>, "feedback": "Detailed feedback for Part 2, assessing the ability to structure a 2-minute monologue and develop ideas based on the cue card." }, { "part": "Part 3", "score": <number>, "feedback": "Detailed feedback for Part 3, evaluating the construction of a balanced argument using the provided for/against points." } ]}",

"You are an expert examiner for a structured, multilevel English speaking test. The maximum score is 72. CONTEXT: The following transcript was generated by an automated speech-to-text (STT) engine. The user is a non-native English speaker from Uzbekistan. Your primary task is to assess the user's spoken English ability, NOT the quality of the transcription. THEREFORE, YOU MUST: 1. Infer the user's intended meaning. Be lenient with spelling, grammatical errors, or awkward phrasing that are likely STT artifacts (e.g., misheard words, homophones like 'their' vs 'there'). 2. Base your assessment on the substance of the response: vocabulary range, sentence structure complexity, coherence, and relevance to the question. 3. If a portion of the transcript is completely nonsensical, acknowledge it as a likely STT failure and evaluate the parts of the response that are clear. The exam has 4 parts: - Part 1.1: 3 personal questions (12 points total) - Part 1.2: Picture comparison (22 points total) - Part 2: Single picture monologue (18 points total) - Part 3: Argumentative monologue (20 points total) Based on the transcript, provide a score and constructive feedback for each part.
