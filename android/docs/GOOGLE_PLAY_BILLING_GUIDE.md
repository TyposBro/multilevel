# Google Play Billing Integration Guide

This document explains how to use, test, and maintain the Google Play Billing implementation in the Spiko Android app.

## üìã Overview

The app uses Google Play Billing Library 8.0.0 with a clean architecture that separates concerns:

- **BillingClientWrapper**: Interface for billing operations
- **BillingClientWrapperImpl**: Real implementation for production
- **FakeBillingClientWrapper**: Test implementation for debug builds
- **BillingTestHelper**: Testing utilities for debug builds

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

```
UI Layer (SubscriptionScreen)
    ‚Üì
ViewModel (SubscriptionViewModel)
    ‚Üì
Repository (SubscriptionRepository)
    ‚Üì
BillingClientWrapper
    ‚Üì
Google Play Billing / FakeBillingClient
```

## üîß Configuration

### 1. Product IDs
The app currently supports these subscription products:
- `silver_monthly` - Silver tier monthly subscription
- `gold_monthly` - Gold tier monthly subscription

### 2. Build Variants
- **Debug builds**: Use `FakeBillingClientWrapper` for testing
- **Release builds**: Use `BillingClientWrapperImpl` for real purchases

### 3. Permissions
Required permissions are already configured in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="com.android.vending.billing" />
```

## üß™ Testing

### Debug Testing (Recommended)

1. **Use Debug Builds**: Debug builds automatically use the fake billing client
2. **Access Debug Screen**: Add navigation to `BillingDebugScreen` in your debug builds
3. **Test Scenarios**: Use the debug screen to simulate different billing scenarios

```kotlin
// Example: Add to your debug navigation
composable("billing_debug") {
    BillingDebugScreen(onNavigateBack = { navController.popBackStack() })
}
```

### Unit Tests

Run billing unit tests:
```bash
./gradlew testBilling
```

### Integration Tests

Run integration tests on connected device:
```bash
./gradlew testBillingIntegration
```

### Complete Test Suite

Run all billing tests:
```bash
./gradlew testBillingFull
```

## üì± Testing on Real Devices

### Google Play Console Setup

1. **Upload APK**: Upload a signed APK to Google Play Console
2. **Create Products**: Create subscription products with IDs matching your app
3. **Add Test Accounts**: Add test accounts for purchase testing
4. **Enable Testing**: Use Google Play Console testing tracks

### Test Account Setup

1. Go to Google Play Console ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Monetize ‚Üí Products ‚Üí Subscriptions
2. Add test accounts in the "License Testing" section
3. Install the app via Google Play Store (not direct APK install)

### Testing Real Purchases

```kotlin
// In release builds, this will trigger real Google Play Billing
viewModel.launchGooglePlayPurchase(activity, productDetails)
```

## üêõ Debugging

### Common Issues

1. **Billing Unavailable**
   - Ensure app is installed via Google Play Store
   - Check Google Play Services is updated
   - Verify test account is added to Google Play Console

2. **Product Not Found**
   - Verify product IDs match Google Play Console
   - Ensure products are active in console
   - Check app version matches uploaded APK

3. **Purchase Already Owned**
   - Use Google Play Console to cancel test subscriptions
   - Or use different test accounts

### Debug Logging

All billing operations are logged with tag `"BillingClient"`. Filter logs:
```bash
adb logcat | grep BillingClient
```

### Debug Screen Features

The `BillingDebugScreen` provides:
- Real-time billing status
- Manual product queries
- Purchase simulation
- State reset
- Live logging

## üîÑ Purchase Flow

### 1. Initialization
```kotlin
// ViewModel initializes billing client
billingClient.startConnection()
```

### 2. Product Query
```kotlin
// Query available products
billingClient.queryProductDetails(listOf("silver_monthly", "gold_monthly"))
```

### 3. Purchase Launch
```kotlin
// Launch purchase flow
billingClient.launchPurchaseFlow(activity, productDetails)
```

### 4. Purchase Verification
```kotlin
// Verify with backend and acknowledge
verifyAndAcknowledgePurchase(provider, token, planId, purchase)
```

## üîí Security

### Backend Verification

All purchases are verified with your backend:
```kotlin
// Purchase token is sent to backend for verification
subscriptionRepository.verifyPurchase("google", purchaseToken, planId)
```

### Service Account

Ensure your backend has proper Google Service Account credentials for verification.

## üìà Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Connection Success Rate**: `isReady` state changes
2. **Purchase Success Rate**: Successful vs failed purchases
3. **Verification Success Rate**: Backend verification results
4. **Error Frequencies**: Different billing error codes

### Analytics Events

Consider tracking these events:
- Billing client connected
- Product details loaded
- Purchase initiated
- Purchase completed
- Purchase verified
- Billing errors

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

### Before Release

- [ ] Test with real Google Play Console setup
- [ ] Verify all product IDs exist and are active
- [ ] Test with multiple test accounts
- [ ] Verify backend verification works
- [ ] Test purchase restoration
- [ ] Test network error scenarios
- [ ] Verify analytics tracking

### Release Configuration

- [ ] Use release build (real billing client)
- [ ] Ensure signed APK uploaded to Play Console
- [ ] Products are active in Play Console
- [ ] Test accounts configured
- [ ] Backend service account configured

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode Issues

If debug testing isn't working:
1. Verify you're using a debug build
2. Check `BillingModule` in debug source set
3. Confirm `FakeBillingClientWrapper` is being injected

### Production Issues

If real purchases aren't working:
1. Verify app is installed via Play Store
2. Check Google Play Console product setup
3. Verify backend service account credentials
4. Check test account configuration

### Getting Help

1. Check Android logs: `adb logcat | grep BillingClient`
2. Use the debug screen for real-time status
3. Review Google Play Console for account/product issues
4. Test with known working test accounts
